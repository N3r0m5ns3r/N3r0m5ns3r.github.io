# Stoicism and Meditations.
## A deep dive into the notes of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.

#### The notes are compiled into a book called [meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations)

After reading the book and researching stoicism for a while i have finally decided to put my thoughts into writing.
These ideas freed me and opened a world a mental state that i have never considered or even thought could be achieved, i was calmer more focused and especially less distracted from external stimuli.
